                - **Inferences:**
                    - From this correlation plot, we can verify that higher the `loan_grade`, higher the `loan_int_rate`. But since their correlation is as high as 0.94, we can proceed to drop loan_grade and keep only loan_int_rate to avoid multicollinearity.
                    - `age` and `cb_cred_hist` having a high correlation of 0.88. It is obvious that higher the age, the longer their credit histories would be. We can drop the age columnm as well for aforementioned reasons.

                - **Other observations:**
                    - `cb_default` has a correlation of 0.55 with loan_grade and 0.50 with loan_interest_rate. This means that the loans for defaulters are usually associated with high risk. Hence, the higher interest rate and grade.
                    - `loan_amount` has a high correlation of 0.65 with loan_percent_income indicating that higher the loan amount, the larger it tends to be of a person's income.
                    - `loan_amount` has a positive correlation of 0.34 with person_income. Indicating that higher income people tend to take larger loans.

                - **Correlations with target variable (loan_status):**
                    - `loan_grade` (0.39) and `loan_interest_rate` (0.34): indicates that riskier loans associated with higher interest rates have higher chances of loan being defaulted.
                    - `loan_percent_income` (0.38): higher the commitment of income to loan, higher the chances of default.
                    - `cb_default` (0.19): indicates that people who defaulted on a loan in the past are more likely to default again.
                    - `loan_amount` (0.14): indicates that people who take larger loans are more likely to default.
                    - `person_income` (-0.18) and `emp_length` (-0.18): indicates that people with higher incomes/ longer employment lengths are less likely to default.

                - **Key inferences:**
                    - There isn't much difference among the correlations various types of `loan_intent`.
                    - However, the relationship exhibited by two `home_ownership` categories RENT and MORTGAGE are quite interesting.
                - **Home Ownership:**
                    - `income` and `emp_length`:
                        - MORTGAGE: income (0.30) and emp_length (0.29) shows that mortgage seems to be the most common mode of housing ownership for people with higher income and those who are well into their career.
                        - RENT: income (-0.28) and emp_length (-0.29) shows that renting is more common among people with lower income and those who are just starting their careers.

                    - `loan_int_rate`, `loan_percent_income`, `cb_default`:
                        - MORTGAGE: loan_int_rate (-0.20), loan_percent_income (-0.16), cb_default (-0.10) shows that people with mortgage tend to have lower interest rates, lower percentage of income committed to loans, and are less likely to default.
                        - RENT: loan_int_rate (0.20), loan_percent_income (0.15), cb_default (0.24) shows that people with rent tend to have higher interest rates, higher percentage of income committed to loans, and are more likely to default.
