st.markdown("""
            The approval of loans is a critical decision for financial institutions, influenced by a multitude of factors ranging from applicant demographics to financial behavior.
            It is also important from an applicant's perspective as to how their personal financial behaviors, housing stability, and credit history influence approval odds, empowering them to make informed decisions when seeking loans.
            To optimize risk assessment and lending strategies, it is essential to identify the key drivers of loan approval outcomes.
            This project aims to analyze a dataset containing applicant profiles and loan characteristics and to predict the likelihood of loan approval based on the attributes available in the dataset.
